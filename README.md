## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Setup
### Frontend
Frontend Setup: [Frontend Setup](/client/README.md)
### Backend
Backend Setup: [Backend Setup](/server/README.md)

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.


## Roadmap
This is a initial MVP or concept, In future we will be converting this to autorized dealership mangement along with product authentication. In this project we are limited to few categories.
